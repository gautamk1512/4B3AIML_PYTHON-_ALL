# Topic 02: Variables and Tokens

# Questions
# 1. What is an identifier?
# 2. List Python data types.
# 3. How do you write comments?
# 4. What are operators?
# 5. What are keywords?
# 6. Explain operator precedence.
# 7. How do you perform type conversion?

# Notes
# Identifiers: Names for variables, functions, etc.
# Data types: int, float, str, bool, list, tuple, dict, set
# Comments: # for single-line, ''' or """ for multi-line
# Operators: +, -, *, /, etc.
# Keywords: Reserved words
# Operator precedence: Order of evaluation
# Type conversion: int(), float(), str(), etc.
